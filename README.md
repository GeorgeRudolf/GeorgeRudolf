Hello. This is where I upload things that may be of interest or some usefulness to the community.

Currently, I'm usually busy tinkering with Transputer garbage, sometimes DEC gear (and compatibles).

While I don't attach a proper license to each repository, unless otherwise specified, all the hardware published herein is free for personal use. You can get as many boards made as you'd like to, and even resell them, provided you do so at cost. Commercial, for-profit use is prohibited. Get in touch if in doubt.

If you need to reach me about something that is not an issue with the designs themselves (for that, please open an issue), feel free to do so by email, via george.rudolf.mezzomo (at-mark) gmail.com. If anything in here has helped you, and you feel like buying me a sandwich or a tin of mints, that address also doubles as PayPal tip jar ðŸ˜ƒ

DISCLAIMER: the projects herein present are published as-is. No guarantee of performance or fitness for use, express or implicit, is provided. Acquiring the files pertaining to these projects implies in agreeing to not hold the author liable for any issues that may arise from the projects' use. They will have been tested to verify minimum functionality, but issues may still be present. Any flaws will be rectified as soon as discovered, to the best of the author's abilities. This includes BoM errors, layout/schematic inaccuracies, and other engineering defects.
